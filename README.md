## Settings
These settings are set automatically when you start the extension. You can also manually configure your user name and token. Go to `File > Preferences > User Settings` and add these lines:
```
{
    "shareCode.pastebin.username": "...",
    "shareCode.pastebin.authtoken": "...",
    "shareCode.github.username": "...",
    "shareCode.github.authtoken": "...",
    "shareCode.gitlab.baseurl": "...",
    "shareCode.gitlab.authtoken": "..."
}
```
Pastebin authtoken can be obtained from https://pastebin.com/doc_api#9, this extension expects the `api_user_key` that can fetched by providing the developer key provided on the [api page](https://pastebin.com/doc_api#1).

## Reset Github token
Sometimes it is necessary to delete a token. Go to this [page](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and delete the token named `VSCode Share Code`.
